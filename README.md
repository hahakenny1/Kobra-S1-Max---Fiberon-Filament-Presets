# Kobra-S1-Max---Fiberon-Filament-Presets
My custom filament configurations for Polymaker Fiberon Filaments for the Anycubic Kobra S1 Max

1. How to Install
These profiles are designed for Anycubic Slicer Next (based on OrcaSlicer).

Launch Anycubic Slicer Next.

Go to File > Import > Import Configs...

Select the included .anycubic_filament file(s).

The profiles will now appear in your Filament dropdown list (likely under "User" or "Custom").

Note: Ensure your printer nozzle size matches the profile (0.4mm Hardened Steel is recommended for abrasive filaments like CF/GF).
